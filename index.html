		<h2>All About Vic</h2>
		<p>Vic is a firefigher and paramedic at Station 19. She originally went to school for musical theater, but after a fire broke out in her school, she realized her true passion for firefighting. Vic is strong and kind to everyone she meets however it takes time to really get to know her. She, along with her best friend Dean Miller, started Crisis One, a intervention resource for conflicts and small injuries without police presence.</p>
